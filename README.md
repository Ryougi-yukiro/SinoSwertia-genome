Multi‐omics reveal differentiation and maintenance of dimorphic flowers in an alpine plant on the Qinghai‐Tibet Plateau


This repo just usr for save some early genomic data for this paper.

This genome just use for early analysis, dont  present the final genome.

There are some mistake about gene annonation.

However ,it dont influence the evolution analysis and the basci function analysis.

St.LG.zip is the gff for the genome.

The release is the genome fasta of the dimorphic flower.

I raraly use github because of the chinese firewall.

The update and notices maybe is Very delayed
